## Development Process

### Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Urgent production fixes

### Testing

All code must have appropriate test coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Run linter
npm run lint

# Fix linting issues
npm run lint:fix

# Type checking
npm run type-check
```

## Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/TypeScript Style

We follow the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with some modifications:

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Maximum line length of 100 characters

Example:
```javascript
// Good
const miner = {
  address: '1GzHriuokSrZYAZEEWoL7eeCCXsX3WyLHa',
  hashrate: 1000000,
  shares: 42
};

// Bad
const miner={address:"1GzHriuokSrZYAZEEWoL7eeCCXsX3WyLHa",hashrate:1000000,shares:42}
```

### File Naming

- Use kebab-case for file names: `payment-processor.js`
- Use PascalCase for classes: `PaymentProcessor`
- Use camelCase for variables and functions: `processPayment()`

### Comments

- Write self-documenting code
- Use JSDoc for functions and classes
- Keep comments concise and relevant

```javascript
/**
 * Process payments for miners
 * @param {Array<Miner>} miners - List of miners to pay
 * @returns {Promise<PaymentResult>} Payment transaction results
 */
async function processPayments(miners) {
  // Implementation
}
```

## Translation Guidelines

We support 100+ languages! To contribute translations:

### Adding a New Language

1. **Create language file**
   ```bash
   cp lib/i18n/locales/en.json lib/i18n/locales/YOUR_LANG_CODE.json
   ```

2. **Update language manager**
   ```javascript
   // In lib/i18n/language-manager.js
   'YOUR_LANG_CODE': {
     name: 'Language Name',
     nativeName: 'Native Name',
     rtl: false // Set true for RTL languages
   }
   ```

3. **Translate all keys**
   - Keep placeholders like `{{variable}}`
   - Maintain the same JSON structure
   - Consider cultural context

### Translation Best Practices

- Use formal language for professional terms
- Be consistent with terminology
- Test RTL languages thoroughly
- Include number and date format preferences
