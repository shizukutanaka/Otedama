```

## Step 6: Push to GitHub
```bash
# For first push to main branch
git push -u origin main

# If the branch is named 'master'
git push -u origin master

# For subsequent pushes
git push
```

## Alternative: Force Push (if needed)
```bash
# Only use if you're sure you want to overwrite remote
git push --force origin main
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you get authentication errors:
1. Use Personal Access Token instead of password
2. Generate token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. Use token as password when prompted

### If you need to set up credentials:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### If remote already exists:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/shizukutanaka/Otedama.git
```

### To check remote URL:
```bash
git remote -v
```
