# Otedama - Statement of Work (SOW)

## Project Overview
Otedama is an enterprise-grade P2P mining pool platform with integrated DEX and DeFi capabilities. Built following the design principles of John Carmack (performance), Robert C. Martin (clean architecture), and Rob Pike (simplicity).

## API Endpoints

### Mining Pool
- `GET /api/v1/mining/stats` - Pool statistics
- `GET /api/v1/mining/miner/:address` - Miner information
- `POST /api/v1/mining/submit` - Submit share

### DEX Trading
- `GET /api/v1/dex/orderbook/:symbol` - Order book
- `POST /api/v1/dex/order` - Place order
- `DELETE /api/v1/dex/order/:id` - Cancel order
- `GET /api/v1/dex/ticker/:symbol` - 24h ticker

### DeFi Services
- `GET /api/v1/defi/yield/pools` - Yield pools
- `POST /api/v1/defi/yield/stake` - Stake tokens
- `POST /api/v1/defi/lending/borrow` - Borrow assets

## Deployment Options

### Standalone Mode
```bash
node index.js --standalone --enable-dex --enable-defi --coinbase-address YOUR_ADDRESS
```

### Enterprise Cluster
```bash
node index.js --enterprise --cluster-workers 8 --ha-nodes node1:5556,node2:5556
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through:
1. Environment variables (.env files)
2. Command-line arguments
3. Configuration files (config/default.js)

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Network traffic uses TLS encryption
- Private keys never leave the secure enclave
- Regular security audits performed
- Bug bounty program active

## Maintenance & Support

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics exposed on /metrics
- Grafana dashboards included
- Real-time alerting via webhook

### Backup & Recovery
- Automated daily backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Geo-replicated storage

### Updates
- Zero-downtime rolling updates
- Automatic rollback on failure
- Version compatibility checks

## Future Roadmap

### Q1 2025
- [ ] Stratum V2 protocol support
- [ ] Additional DEX features (options, futures)
- [ ] Mobile application release

### Q2 2025
- [ ] Layer 2 scaling solutions
- [ ] Advanced analytics dashboard
- [ ] AI-powered trading strategies

### Q3 2025
